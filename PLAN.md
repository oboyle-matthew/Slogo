# API Details

One API that we were going to create is the PreviousCommands API. This API would be created in order to show the user the previous commands that they typed into the text box. We may also make it possible for the user to load these commands again simply by clicking on them, making this an external API (it interacts with both the front-end and the back-end). We feel that this would be a very good addition, because it allows the user to save time typing in the same commands over and over again as it should be very common that the user wants to re-create a command that they typed in. This API should also separate the front and the back end of the project so that it follows the black-box model of hiding how things are actually implemented on the inside. Therefore, the front-end doesnâ€™t even know why the words will be displayed on the screen, all it does is display them in a certain box if the back-end tells it to. 

There will also be another API that allows the user to input their commands. This string will be passed to the back-end through the StringParser class in order to decide what command should be implemented. The front-end will then be passed back a command saying where it should move, and using its current conditions (Eg. The orientation of the turtle, whether the pen is up or down etc.) it will execute this. The back-end will pass the front-end an old location and a new location, the front-end takes this in and moves the turtle to the new location, and draws a line between the two locations only if the pendown variable is true.

The Turtle class in our program will have instance variables such as PenDown, xLocation, yLocation, Orientation, myImage. This class will then have constructors in order to move the turtle, draw a line between two points, change the rotation of the turtle, and toggle the pen on and off. Because the image of the turtle is an instance variable, we can actually make it possible that the user can change the image of the turtle if they want to at any point.
