NOTE: As I already completed this for the basic implementation, I will instead try to work on my editable properties box

    Estimation: before looking at the old code:
        how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
        how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
        
        I think this will take roughly 30 minutes and should ony need to update one class. 

After you have completed the code, answer the following questions at the end of your ADDITION.md file as another separate commit.

    Review: after completing the feature:
        how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
        how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
        did you get it completely right on the first try?
    Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
        was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
        what could be improved?
        what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
        
 I was roughly correct in my estimate and only needed to update one class as predicted.
 I feel that my design was very good and made it easy to do this, however it was not well documented. If I was not familiar with the code this would have been much harder.
